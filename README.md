# **CoinToss**
###### CoinToss is a web application built in JavaScript. It randomly generates heads or tails result by rotating a virtual coin back and forth in the user's device. This app was made for a local Cricket Club named Everest CC, who uses this app instead of tossing a real coin at the match's start. ######
